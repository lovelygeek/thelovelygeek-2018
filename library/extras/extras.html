<p>#Plate Theme Extras</p>

<p>####Just a few bits in here that we often use at studio.bio. If you don&#8217;t need any of this, delete or just leave it alone.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve placed it in the <code>/extras</code> folder because they are&#8230;wait for it&#8230;<em>extras</em> that you may or may not need or want.</p>

<p>##Icons
Retina credit card icons in .svg format. We use these to replace the default Gravity Forms icons which are still not retina (<em>le sigh</em>).</p>

<p>How to use with Gravity Forms (for example with the Stripe CC field block):</p>

<p>.gform_card_icon_amex {
background-image: url(../images/icons/amex.svg) !important;
background-position: 0 0 !important;
background-size: 36px 32px;
}</p>
